# TP-GUI
Just for fun. 

I'm trying to find a way to "drag and drop" a xlsx file and make it import all the data and store it in a database so I can pull the information by sending queries and use it for analitics and reports. 
Planning to add a feature to get those reports graphically. 

But Kenny, that's something you can do with Excel itself... I don't know nothing about that bruh.
